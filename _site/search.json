    "text": "Introduction\nOceanus is an island nation with a thriving commercial fishing market where most companies adhere to regulations and sustainable practices. However, some companies prioritise profit over ethics, engaging in illegal activities. Hence, FishEye International, a non-profit organisation combating illegal fishing, has created a knowledge graph called CatchNet: the Oceanus Knowledge Graph from diverse data sources to maintain a watchful eye on fishing data for compliance and sustainability in the industry.\nRecently, the commercial fishing sector was disrupted when SouthSeafood Express Corp was caught engaging in illegal fishing. FishEye seeks to analyse temporal patterns and infer the impacts of this incident on the fishing marketplace. The competitive nature of the market may lead some businesses to capture SouthSeafood’s market share, while others may recognise the consequences of illegal activities.\nFishEye is highly invested in developing visualisation tools that work with CatchNet to help analysts better identify bias, track behaviour changes, and infer temporal patterns. In turn, to identify the people who own nefarious companies or business networks and hold them accountable."

    "text": "Motivation\nThe primary motivation for our task is to develop visualisations to show changes in business relationships within the commercial fishing industry. This will allow FishEye to better understand how companies react to the closure of a competitor caught fishing illegally and how these changes affect influence networks. The recent incident involving SouthSeafood Express Corp’s illegal fishing activities has also raised concerns about the potential ripple effects and changes within the fishing marketplace.\nFishEye International aims to leverage visual analytics techniques to analyse the complex business networks, ownership structures, and transactions within the commercial fishing industry to identify and prevent illegal fishing activities in the sensitive marine ecosystem of the Oceanus region."

Based on the analyses conducted in tasks 1 to 3, further investigate if there are any other suspicious transactions."

It will consist of several tabs, highlighting important information related to the tasks:\n\nTemporal Analysis: This tab will provide visualisations to highlight temporal patterns and changes in corporate structures, focusing on the most active people and businesses over time.\nTransaction Analysis: This tab will feature an interactive network graph (visNetwork) that visualises different groups of businesses and their transactions, allowing users to explore typical and atypical business activities (e.g., mergers, acquisitions).\nInfluence Analysis: This tab will propose clusters based on user-defined criteria, enabling analysts to examine the changing influence of companies, including potential ownership or influence within business networks.\nCase Study: SouthSeafood Express Corp: This tab will focus specifically on the network associated with SouthSeafood Express Corp, visualising how this network and competing businesses changed in response to their illegal fishing behaviour. It will aim to identify companies that potentially benefited from SouthSeafood Express Corp’s legal troubles and uncover any other suspicious transactions related to illegal fishing activities.\n\nThe proposed Shiny App will leverage interactive visualisations, clustering algorithms, and evaluative metrics to provide FishEye International with a comprehensive visual analytics tool for uncovering patterns, relationships, and potential indicators of illegal fishing activities within the Oceanus region."

For this project, the group will be attempting mini challenge 3 which aims to use visual analysis to carry out temporal analysis and identify the people who hold influence over business networks in Oceanus.\n\nMini-Challenge 3: Temporal Analysis\nOceanus’s commercial fishing business community was rocked by the news that SouthSeafood Express Corp was caught fishing illegally. FishEye wants to understand temporal patterns and infer what may be happening in Oceanus’s fishing marketplace because of SouthSeafood Express Corp’s illegal behavior and eventual closure. The competitive nature of Oceanus’s fishing market may cause some businesses to react aggressively to capture SouthSeafood Express Corp’s business while other reactions may come from the awareness that illegal fishing does not go undetected and unpunished.\nChallenge tasks and objectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a visual analytics approach that analysts can use to highlight temporal patterns and changes in corporate structures. Examine the most active people and businesses using visual analytics.\n\n\n\nUsing visualisations to find and display examples of typical and atypical business transactions (e.g., mergers, acquisitions, etc.). Can you infer the motivations behind changes in their activity?\n\n\n\nDeveloping a visual approach to examine inferences. Infer how the influence of a company changes through time. Can you infer ownership or influence that a network may have?.\n\n\n\nIdentifying the network associated with SouthSeafood Express Corp and visualize how this network and competing businesses change as a result of their illegal fishing behavior. Especially, the companies that benefited from SouthSeafood Express Corp’s legal troubles.\n\n\n\nA poster will also be developed to highlight:\nIssues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and problems your project addresses.\nMotivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are interesting and what make them difficult to solve.\nApproach - A description of the techniques or algorithms you used to solve the problem.\nResults - Screenshots and a working demo of the system (R Shiny Application) you built.\nFuture Work - An explanation of how the work could be extended."
